# WorldCupBettings

This is a small Dashboard to collect some informations about our betting game.

To start, please follow these steps:
- (for the first installation only) Make sure, that pandas, dash, dash-bootstrap-components and plotly is installed.
- open the Excel-file 'input_form.xlsx' and fill in your guesses for all games of the group-phase.
- Send the file to 'marcel.cech@student.uni-tuebingen.de' and deposit the agreed bet.

Later during the run of the world cup:
- run app.py via "python app.py" in your command line/anaconda prompt and open the displayed local link.

Please note, that I have to fill in the results manually, so please approach me, if there's anything wrong.
